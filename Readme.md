# Github Followers

Github Followers is the first 100% programmatic UI (no storyboard) app that I built. It was a lot of fun making Github Followers. I  gained experience and knowledge with some of Appleâ€™s cool frameworks and features.

-   Support light & dark mode.
-   Setup empty state view for *UICollectionView* or *UITableView*.
-   Utilizing custom *UICollectionViewFlowLayout* to layout *UICollectionView*.
-   Layout UI programmatically without using storyboards.
-   Combine *UISearchController* and *NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot* to create a smooth animation while searching.

# Technology Used
